# Fake DSMs (and other mods)
There are a lot of fake versions of Danker's Skyblock Mod. The correct one is at https://github.com/bowser0000/SkyblockMod

Please, if something on GitHub does not have its source code public, don't use it, or at least do your research. There are quite a few of these fake repos popping up, so please don't fall for them
